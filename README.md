A custom 2D figurine optimized for 1x1 grids in Tabletop Simulator!

Are you tired of the bulky metal base used for the custom figurine model? Do you hate how shiny the base looks or how hard it is to knock over pieces due to its heft? Does it bother you how tiny your image looks when you shrink down the base to fit into a 1x1 grid space?

Well I don't know about you, but after fruitlessly combing through the workshop for an alternative solution, I set out and learned how to model the damn thing myself instead. Now you too can enjoy the fruits of my labor! The main benefit, besides the better-sized figurines for 1x1 grids, is you can set custom textures for the top, bottom, and side of the base. You can even opt to use no textures for the base at all if you simply want an invisible base.

Everything you need to make your own models is included here, so you technically don't need to subcribe, however I'd appreciate it if you drop a comment below. Enjoy!

Changelog:
3/29/2017 - Now updated with better instructions, which are available below and in the mod itself.

3/31/2017 - Updated model to use new obj file link so it no longer spawns the piece in broken. However, if you still have issues you can use this alternative model mesh link instead:

INSTRUCTIONS

To start, first you need to create your image using the blank PNG template, which can be found here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rokem/TTS_Custom_2D_Figurine/master/Layout-Blank.png

I recommend using GIMP or Photoshop to create the image, and be sure to save it as a PNG if you want transparency. Once you have your image created, upload it to your preferred image host (or simply use the built in steam upload method), and then use one of the two methods below to create the actual model.


METHOD 1 - CLONING AN EXISTING MODEL:

*Save the default model to your chest (Optional).
*Whenever you want to create a new model, spawn it from your chest, right click on the model, and click "Custom".
*Change the Diffuse Image link with a link to your newly minted image file instead.
*Import your new model and bask in your new creation!
*Don't forget to give a thumbs up if you found this useful! :D

METHOD 2 - CREATING A NEW MODEL FROM SCRATCH:

*Create a new custom model in Tabletop Simulator using the following parameters:

*Model/mesh:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rokem/TTS_Custom_2D_Figurine/master/FigurineModel.obj

*Diffuse Image:
Link to your newly minted image file.

*Normal/Bump:
Leave Blank.

*Collider (Same file link as model/mesh):
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rokem/TTS_Custom_2D_Figurine/master/FigurineModel.obj

*Leave Non-Convex unchecked.
*Set the type to "Figurine". 
*Under the Material tab, choose cardboard.
*Import your new model and bask in your new creation!
*Don't forget to give a thumbs up if you found this useful! :D
