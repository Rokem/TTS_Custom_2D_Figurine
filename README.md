# TTS_Custom_2D_Figurine
A custom 2D figurine optimized for 1x1 grids in Tabletop Simulator.

You can simply edit the blank PNG or use the included PSD file in the link above to create your figurines. Once you have the image created, create a new custom model in TTS and use the following parameters:

For model/mesh:

Diffuse Image:
Upload your image to steam or whatever your preferred image host is.

Normal/Bump:
Leave Blank

Collider (You can leave blank, but I put the obj file here):
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rokem/TTS_Custom_2D_Figurine/master/FigurineModel.obj

Leave Non-Convex unchecked and set the type to "figurine". Under the Material tab, choose cardboard. Then simply import your new model and bask in your new creation!

You don't need to stay subcribed to my mod, but please give a thumbs up if you found this useful. Enjoy!
