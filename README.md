A custom 2D figurine optimized for 1x1 grids in Tabletop Simulator!

Are you tired of the bulky metal base used for the custom figurine model? Do you hate how shiny the base looks or how hard it is to knock over pieces due to its heft? Does it bother you how tiny your image looks when you shrink down the base to fit into a 1x1 grid space?

Well I don't know about you, but after putting up with it for several months, and combing through the workshop fruitlessly for an alternative, I decided to learn how to model the damn thing myself instead. Now you too can enjoy the fruits of my labor! The main benefit besides the better sized figurines for 1x1 grids is you can set custom textures for the top, bottom, and side of the base. You can even use no textures for the base iif you simply want an invisible base.

Everything you need to make your own models is included here, so you technically don't need to subcribe, however If you found this useful at all I'd really appreciate the thumbs up. Enjoy!



INSTRUCTIONS

To start, you first need to create your image using the blank PNG template, which can be found here:
https://github.com/Rokem/TTS_Custom_2D_Figurine/blob/master/Layout-Blank.png?raw=true

I recommend using GIMP or Photoshop to create the image, and be sure to save it as a PNG if you want transparency. Once you have your image created, simply create a new custom model and use the following parameters:

Model/mesh:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rokem/TTS_Custom_2D_Figurine/master/FigurineModel.obj

Diffuse Image:
Link to your newly minted image file (upload it to steam or another preferred image host).

Normal/Bump:
Leave Blank.

Collider (You can leave this blank, but I put the obj file here anyway becuase ???): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rokem/TTS_Custom_2D_Figurine/master/FigurineModel.obj

Leave Non-Convex unchecked.
Set the type to "figurine". 
Under the Material tab, choose cardboard.
Import your new model and bask in your new creation!
