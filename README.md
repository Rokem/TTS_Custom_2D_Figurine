A custom 2D figurine optimized for 1x1 grids in Tabletop Simulator!

Are you tired of the bulky metal base used for the custom figurine model? Do you hate how shiny the base looks or how hard it is to knock over pieces due to its heft? Does it bother you how tiny your image looks when you shrink down the base to fit into a 1x1 grid space?

Well I don't know about you, but after fruitlessly combing through the workshop for an alternative solution, I set out and learned how to model the damn thing myself instead. Now you too can enjoy the fruits of my labor! The main benefit, besides the better-sized figurines for 1x1 grids, is you can set custom textures for the top, bottom, and side of the base. You can even opt to use no textures for the base at all if you simply want an invisible base.

Everything you need to make your own models is included here, so you technically don't need to subcribe, however I'd appreciate it if you drop a comment below. Enjoy!

Oh and feel free to use these in your own mods, just drop me a shout out if you do :D
  
## CHANGELOG
2/20/2020 - Tinting now only applies to figurine base. Fixed seam issues.  
8/20/2018 - Updated the instructions within the mod to make them clearer to understand.  
3/4/2018 - Updated the description with even better instructions.  
4/2/2017 - New Two-Sided Version! It spawns in backwards, don't ask why.  
3/31/2017 - Updated model to use new obj file link so it no longer spawns the piece in broken.  
3/29/2017 - Now updated with better instructions, which are available below and in the mod itself.  
  
## INSTRUCTIONS
STEP 1: Use one of the templates below to create your image. I recommend using GIMP or Photoshop to edit the template. When you are done, save the image as a PNG to preserve transparency. There are lots of tutorials online and on youtube if you are unfamiliar with how to use these programs.

STEP 2: Once you have created your image, upload it to the internet. I recommend using the in-game upload feature.  
STEP 3: Use method A or B to create the model in Tabletop Simulator.  
  
  
#### METHOD A: CLONING AN EXISTING MODEL
STEP 1: Save the default models to your chest.  
STEP 2: Whenever you want to create a new model, spawn it from your chest, right click on the model, and click "Custom".  
STEP 3: Change the Diffuse Image link with a link to your newly minted image file instead.  
STEP 4: Import your new model and bask in your new creation!  
STEP 5: (OPTIONAL) Edit the name and description of your newly created model.
STEP 6: Don't forget to give this mod a thumbs up if you found this useful! :D  
  
  
#### METHOD B: CREATING A NEW MODEL FROM SCRATCH
STEP 1: to create a new custom model in Tabletop Simulator, go to Objects > Components > Custom > Model.  
STEP 2: For the MODEL/MESH and COLLIDER parameters, use the link below which matches the figurine type you want to create.
